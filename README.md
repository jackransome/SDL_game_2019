This image shows the contents of the folder. The DLLs foler is not necessary, I use it to keep track of 32/64bit DLLs form the libraries

In addition to having this libraries folder, glew32.dll and SDL2.dll from these libraries must be in the same directory as the compiled .exe in order to run the project
