In order to compile this project you must have the required libraries, stored in a folder called "Libraries", in the main directory of the project as shown below:

This image shows the contents of the folder. The DLLs folder is not necessary, I use it to keep track of 32/64bit DLLs from the libraries

In addition to having this libraries folder, glew32.dll and SDL2.dll from these libraries must be in the same directory as the compiled .exe in order to run the project
